# catalogwatch-ai

CatalogWatch AI is a Phase 1 explainable AI MVP that helps identify music catalogs entering potential copyright termination windows and highlights which ones are worth paying attention to. It takes in catalog metadata, applies simple but configurable time based eligibility logic, uses NLP to pull meaningful ownership signals from messy contract notes, and combines everything into a transparent AI ready score that is easy to understand and audit. The results live in a clean Streamlit dashboard that shows eligibility windows, ownership evidence, visual contribution breakdowns, and supports one click CSV export for deeper review. This project is intentionally scoped as a proof of concept focused on clarity, explainability, and scalability, showing how the system can grow into learned models and automation in later phases without pretending to make legal decisions.
